# SysScout
SysScout is a fully encapsulated script that quickly and easily pulls local machine information from Linux-Based systems.  A simple, easy to use Incident Response and Network Forensics tool.  Unlike other scripts that require installation of dependencies and toolkits, SysScout is ready to deploy on most Linux Distros

### Download, setup & usage
  Run these commands in a Linux-Based Terminal
* git clone https://github.com/joshbrunty/SysScout /opt/SysScout/
* cd /opt/SysScout/
* . SysScout.sh

Usage is pretty easy.  Select from the Main Menu options for the desired information on-screen.
  
Mac Forensicators NOTE: This script works for the most part in MacOS, but not completely (there are some wonky exceptions).  You will also need to use a directory besides /opt as this doesn't exist in HFS+.
