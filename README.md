# SysScout
SysScout is a fully encapsulated bash script that quickly and easily pulls local machine information from Linux-Based systems.  A simple, easy to use Incident Response and Network Forensics tool.  Unlike other scripts that require installation of dependencies and toolkits, SysScout is ready to deploy on most Linux Distros

### Download, Setup & Usage
  To download and run SysScout, run the following commands in a Linux-Based Terminal:
* ```git clone https://github.com/joshbrunty/SysScout /opt/SysScout/```
* ```cd /opt/SysScout/```
* ```./ SysScout.sh``` or ```bash SysScout.sh```

Usage is simple and intuitive.  Select from the Main Menu options of 1-8 to show the desired information on-screen.
  
### Mac & Windows Note
Mac Forensicators, this script works for the most part in MacOS, but not completely (there are some crazy wonky exceptions and outputs).  You will also need to use a directory besides /opt as this doesn't exist in HFS+. If using Windows 10 Bash, the script will run by issuing a bash -c command (i.e. bash -c "SysScout.sh") however, not all menus are supported and/or will not work in Windows.
